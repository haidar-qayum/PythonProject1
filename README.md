# Cardiovascular Health Risk Project
Overview
This project focuses on predicting cardiovascular health risks using Python and the Plotly library. The goal is to identify potential risk factors associated with cardiovascular diseases (CVD) through data visualization, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and statistical analysis.
